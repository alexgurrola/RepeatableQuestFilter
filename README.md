# RepeatableQuestFilter

Overview
--------

This addon enables focused farming or leveling by filtering __repeatable quests__ received by certain __quest givers__.  At the moment, I am supporting the __Dark Brotherhood__ and __Thieves Guild__ repeatable quests obtained through the *Marked for Death* and *Tip Board*, respectively.

Settings
--------

Thieves Guild:

- Crime Spree
- Launder (The Covetous Countess)

Dark Brotherhood:

- Gold Coast
- Aldmeri Dominion
- Daggerfall Covenant
- Ebonheart Pact

Bugs & Requests
---------------

If you experience a bug or have any feature requests, please let me know in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/alexgurrola/RepeatableQuestFilter/issues) on the Github Repository.  Since this is my first addon and first time playing Elder Scrolls Online, there will likely be much more to be desired, so don't be shy.  ;)
